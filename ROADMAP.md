# Roadmap

The working prioritization document: every row is open work, verified against
the tree; a row leaves when the work ships (spec-retire) or a
`/bench-what-next` reconcile removes it. Raw capture never lands here — it
goes to `IDEAS.md` and enters only through a reviewed drain.

## Features, in priority order

**FT3 (MED-LOW) — `bench spec implemented` + `bench commit`.** Pair them:
commit could fold in the spec status flip. Replaces footgun prose in the
implement phase with two small wrappers over existing logic.

**FT4 (MED-LOW) — harness task list in `/bench-implement-spec`.** Per-harness
adapter (Claude hook + phase line; Codex native).

**FT9 (MED-LOW) — compiled git-context command.** One call bundling
status+diff+log+staged for agents. The self-vs-other-writer partitioning fork
is now largely moot: invariant 1 enforces one-writer-per-tree, so the
attribution problem it addressed mostly can't arise. Remaining value is the
call-count reduction, which stands single-writer. Needs its grill to confirm
that value survives without the partitioning story.

**FT10 (LOW) — doctor installs the kit repo's pre-push guard.** `bench guards`
already reports the missing guard; `bench doctor` should detect it on the kit
repo itself and offer the install (consumer repos get it via `bench link`).

**FT5 (LOW) — `bench outline`.** Marginal for this repo, real as a kit
affordance for large/polyglot linked repos. Needs its grill (languages,
on-demand vs committed, prose anchors).

**FT6 (LOW, parked pending evidence — leave parked):** `bench refs`, `bench
detect`, `bench doc`, `bench specs --retired`, doctor binary-presence row,
`conformanceFamilies`-vs-dispatch reconcile meta-check, and a per-anchor
bite-proof meta-test (canaries prove one needle per family today; graduate on
observed anchor rot). `bench symbols` is not carried; restore only if agents
demonstrably burn turns on symbol search.

**FT7 (LOW) — dashboard.** Low priority by declaration.

**FT8 (scheduled, not actionable) — Sonnet 5 mid-tier revisit.** Time-boxed to
2026-09-01 or the next frontier shift.

## Watch

- `bench worktree concurrent-acquire` contract test failed once under
  full-gate load, then passed 3/3 in isolation and on rerun — likely a timing
  flake surfaced by gate phase concurrency. Journal it if it recurs.

## Recommended sequence

1. FT3 pair `bench spec implemented` + `bench commit` — /bench-write-spec
2. FT4 harness task list in `/bench-implement-spec` — /bench-write-spec
