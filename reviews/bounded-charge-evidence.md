# Review outcomes: bounded-charge-evidence

This file holds the review pickup for the `specs/bounded-charge-evidence/spec.md` implementation run.
The fenced record at the end is the machine-readable evidence.

## Run decisions

- The reviewer approved digest-verified reads for oversized charges. The author and each review axis read each omitted repository source at the pinned tip and match its sha256 to the charge identity. Each review axis also matches the diff, consumers, and coverage captures of the frozen pair to their charge identities. A mismatch stops the reader. This approval applies until tickets 4 and 5 replace the full-charge routes.
- The retained author for each ticket is a fork of the coordinator session on opus at high effort. The ticket 1 fork ended with an API error during the CE-C1A review. By reviewer direction, a sonnet write delegate performs the CE-C1A repairs. This is a user-directed author transfer after a terminal author failure.
- The review axes run opus at medium effort, by reviewer direction.

## CE-C1A: review round 1

Frozen pair: base `8e4cf48021ec5a3a576d2f60e40480059e1e8c08`, tip `3f010d4e0ed13d3300e2ed1a47641ff317090f64`.
The raw finding count is 14. The de-duplicated repair-target count is 11.
Repair cycles used: 0 of 2.

### Standards

Finding count: 5. Worst issue: ST1.

- CE-C1A-ST1 (auto-fix): The chunk claims recorded omission probes, but no red record exists in the tree. A test comment in `internal/chargeevidence/format_test.go` states that the review pickup carries the records. The repair records every probe in this pickup and removes the red-record claim from the comment. SP1 names the same repair.
- CE-C1A-ST2 (auto-fix): The header layout and the profile values are stated twice. The reference text in `internal/chargeevidence/schema.go` hard-codes the version, reserved value, and page size. `internal/chargeevidence/pack.go` uses literal offsets. Derive both from the registry constants.
- CE-C1A-ST3 (auto-fix): The source-state and preparation-refusal fixtures in `internal/preflight/charge_evidence_test.go` repeat the setups in `internal/preflight/charge_legacy_pack_test.go`. Use one case table for both tests.
- CE-C1A-ST4 (auto-fix): `internal/preflight/charge_pack.go` computes the source ordinal with `SourceID(i + 2)`. The pack package owns that rule. Export one input-ordinal helper from `internal/chargeevidence`.
- CE-C1A-ST5 (auto-fix): A comment in `internal/preflight/charge_legacy_pack_test.go` narrates history. The build path joins the fence with its own separator, apart from `chargeFenceCell`. State the current fact, and use one fence-cell owner.

### Spec

Finding count: 4. Worst issue: SP1.

- CE-C1A-SP1 (auto-fix): This finding is the same as ST1. Spec line 490 requires a recorded red for each independent expectation before acceptance.
- CE-C1A-SP2 (auto-fix): CE52 tests no ledger record and a foreign active record. No case has a record that owns this worktree in a non-active state. Add that case.
- CE-C1A-SP3 (auto-fix): The CE148 test matches each field label anywhere in the document. An omitted field can pass through a label in another table. Check each field inside its own table row.
- CE-C1A-SP4 (auto-fix): The shipped reference omits facts that an independent reader needs. These facts are the relative page offset, zero-based indexes, the canonical string quoting rules, and the build and review access values. Add them through the registry and the projection.

Flagged for reviewer veto, with no finding ID: spec line 474 names `TestChargeProjectionAndFullRetrieval` as the CE-C1A differential, but row CE147 names `TestLegacyPreparedPackDifferential`. The implementation obeys the row. The CE18 case also changes the ticket, because review mode has an empty ticket. The axis marked that point no-op.

### Coverage

Finding count: 5. Worst issue: CV1 to CV3.

- CE-C1A-CV1 (auto-fix): No test reaches the reader's page-split refusal. A probe that disabled the check was silent.
- CE-C1A-CV2 (auto-fix): No test reaches the reader's source-digest refusal, including a zero-byte optional source. A probe that disabled the check was silent.
- CE-C1A-CV3 (auto-fix): No test reaches the reader's source-bytes refusal. A probe that disabled the check was silent.
- CE-C1A-CV4 (auto-fix): No case pins the integer upper bound or the other noncanonical integer forms. A probe that removed the bound was silent.
- CE-C1A-CV5 (auto-fix): No test covers generated-source provenance rows. A probe that disabled the provenance validation was silent. The coordinator routes this to the repair because the reader already enforces these rows in this chunk.

### Advice

- Rename the `flag` schema helper, because the name reads like the standard library package.
- The legacy differential compares bytes only, and it cannot show that the output came from the pack.
- `Metadata.references()` adds each charge ticket cell, so a later review row with an empty ticket can fail the reader.
- Consider cases for a byte order mark and for a path with a comma or a newline in a manifest cell.

### Author verification

The ticket 1 author ran the plan probe and 34 other probes, and it reported every verdict as `bit` with the file restored. Its detailed log was lost when the author session ended. The repair author reruns and records every probe at the repaired tip.
The coordinator's independent probe swapped the checks and return columns in `internal/preflight/charge_pack.go`. Five tests failed, and the file was restored.
